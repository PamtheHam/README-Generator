# README-Generator

## Description

In this project, I worked to develop a process that makes creating a README.md more quick and simple for the user. In order to demonstrate the application, I created a walk-through video on Screencastify where I show the user how to utilize the application to produce a README.md with the user's input using the inquirer package from NPM.
