README-Generator

## Description
It is an application that uses the Inquirer NPM. The inquirer NPM utilizes the command line to prompt the user to answer questions. The README generator asks the user to input information about a project, and then the README generator creates a new README.md file and sticks the users input into that file.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge of this project was deciding which licenses to include in the README Generator. I stuck with the safe choice, and decided to use the licenses that GitHub lists when you are deciding which licenses are best to use for your project.
